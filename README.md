#LetsPlayNow

LetsPlayNow is an open source jekyll site built for letsplayers to organize all of their social sites into a free Github Pages website. The goal is to make it easier for people who don't have coding skills to create a clean website that shows off the content they create on the platforms they care about.

To create your own LetsPlayNow site follow these steps:

1. Create a github account (or log in)
1. Click Fork on this repository at the top right
1. Edit the _config.yml file in the root of the repository adding your social media usernames, and save the changes.
