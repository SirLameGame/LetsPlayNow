# LetsPlayNow

LetsPlayNow is an open source [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) base for letsplayers to organize all of their social sites into a free [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website. The goal is to make it easier for people who don't have coding skills to create a clean website that shows off the content they create on the platforms they care about. You can see an example here: [sirlamegame.github.io/LetsPlayNow](https://sirlamegame.github.io/LetsPlayNow)

To create your own LetsPlayNow site follow these steps:

1. Create a github account (or log in)
1. Click Fork on this repository at the top right
1. Edit the _config.yml file in the root of the repository adding your social media usernames, and save the changes. [You can edit files right on github using these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).
1. Visit http://<github username>.github.io/LetsPlayNow to see your personalized site

# Custom Domains

You can use a custom domain name with your LetsPlayNow website (such as [SirLameGame.com](https://sirlamegame.com). First you will need to buy a domain name. [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com) is a good option. You can find instructions to setup your NameCheap domain with your LetsPlayNow page with the link below.
